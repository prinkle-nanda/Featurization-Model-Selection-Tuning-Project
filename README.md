# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It focuses on predicting credit card user churn using feature engineering, selection techniques, and model tuning strategies. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive performance

# Key Objectives
  * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
  * Implement Feature Engineering & Selection:
      - Encoding categorical variables
      - Handling missing values
      - Feature scaling and transformation
  * Train and compare multiple Machine Learning models, including:
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - Decision Trees & Random Forest
      - Logistic Regression
  * Optimize models using GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.
  * Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
